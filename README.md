Hey connections! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve just taken my first step into the world of JavaScript and to test what Iâ€™ve learned so far, I built a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator ðŸ§®
Itâ€™s a basic project where users can enter their height and weight, and it instantly shows their BMI. The main idea behind building this was to get hands-on with JS fundamentals like taking user input, performing calculations, and dynamically updating content on the page.

I kept the UI super simple â€” didnâ€™t focus much on styling, because this one was all about learning and experimenting with JavaScript logic. ðŸ’¡
Would love to hear your feedback or suggestions! And if you're also learning JavaScript, letâ€™s connect and grow together. ðŸš€
